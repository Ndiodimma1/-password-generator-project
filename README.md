🔐 Customizable Password Generator
Welcome to my Customizable Password Generator project! This Python-based tool allows users to generate strong, secure passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters based on their preferences. It's fully customizable, simple to use, and a great utility for anyone looking to improve their password security.

💡 Features
Custom Character Selection: Choose how many letters, numbers, and special characters you want in your password.
Randomized Password Generation: Uses Python's random module to generate a completely random and secure password.
User Input Driven: Define the length and content of your password based on your security needs.
Simple & Efficient: Designed for ease of use with clear prompts and outputs.
🚀 How It Works
The user inputs how many letters, numbers, and special characters they want in their password.
The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, numbers, and special characters.
The selections are shuffled to ensure randomness.
The final password is generated and displayed.
